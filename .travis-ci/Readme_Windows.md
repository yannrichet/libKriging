Windows environment for Travis-CI is still in early stages.

Help may be found via the forum : [https://travis-ci.community/c/environments/windows](https://travis-ci.community/c/environments/windows)

Pre-installed packages: [https://docs.travis-ci.com/user/reference/windows/](https://docs.travis-ci.com/user/reference/windows/)

# [Chocolatey](https://chocolatey.org) package manager

Use `choco` command as main package command and is installed by default in Travis-CI windows environment. However `choco` has only few packages available about scientific computing.

Package list is available here: [https://chocolatey.org/search](https://chocolatey.org/search)

# Anaconda package manager

`conda` is an interesting alternative but not available by default in Travis-CI. See `install.sh` script for more information.

[Miniconda](https://docs.conda.io/en/latest/miniconda.html) is one of its client.

Package list is available here: [https://anaconda.org/search](https://anaconda.org/search).
